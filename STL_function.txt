STL Libraries:

In Java, there is no direct Standard Template Library (STL) as in C++. However, Java provides a Collection Framework, which serves a similar purpose by offering a set of ready-to-use data structures and algorithms.

The Java Collection Framework includes:

Lists (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList)
Sets (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet)
Maps (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap)
Queues (e.g., PriorityQueue, Deque)
